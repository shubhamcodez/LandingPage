This project was created with HTML 5, CSS 3, [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
and a lot of frameworks.

## About the Project:
This is a template/ generic landing page made on React.js. <br>
I had to stop working on it because it's boring and client refused to pay. <br>
In his defence, It looks kinda bad. <br>
Feel free to contribute or use it as you like :)
